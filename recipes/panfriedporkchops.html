    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless pork chops</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of cooking oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Do not pat chops dry, so seasonings and flour will stick.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of pork chops with salt and pepper, then 
            sprinkle with flour on both sides. Use the back of a spoon to 
            distribute the flour over the entire surface.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat until 
            it shimmers. Carefully add pork chops and pan fry until brown, 
            about 4 minutes. Do not disturb the chops until ready to turn.</li>
        <li>When you see the edges of the chops turn brown, turn, and pan fry 
            the other side until no longer pink on the inside and brown on the 
            outside, an additional 4 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted 
            into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Reduce heat, 
            if they are browning too quickly. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
